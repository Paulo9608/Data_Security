# Week 4

## Authentication

A -> B: M

witness(A,B,M)         request(B,A,M)


Weak auth   -> no witness matching a request
Strong auth -> more requests than witnesses


## Transport Layer Security

TLS consists of two phases:
- Handshake -> a client and server establish a secure channel: a pair of symmetric keys for communicating
- Transport -> the parties exchange messages in a secure channel
